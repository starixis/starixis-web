        <h2>2. Scope of this notice</h2>
        <p>This notice applies only to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>visitors to the starixis.com website;</li>
          <li>people who contact Starixis through the website or by email; and</li>
          <li>business contacts and prospective collaborators who correspond with Starixis in connection with the website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It covers the technical information generated through normal use of the website and the personal information you provide when you get in touch with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Starixis products, applications, or services, if and when they exist, may involve different processing activities and may be covered by their own, separate privacy notices. This notice does not describe or apply to any product, customer, or user data outside the starixis.com corporate website.

      <section id="information-we-collect">
        <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>Based on how the website currently operates, we collect the following categories of information:</p>
        <h3>Information you provide directly</h3>
        <p>
          If you email us using the address published on the website (contact@starixis.com), we receive whatever information you choose to include, which may typically consist of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>your name;</li>
          <li>your email address;</li>
          <li>your company or organisation;</li>
          <li>your job role;</li>
          <li>a telephone number, if you choose to provide one;</li>
          <li>the content of your enquiry; and</li>
          <li>any further communications you send us as the conversation continues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The website does not run a server-side contact form. The &ldquo;get in touch&rdquo; link opens your own email application and sends your message directly to our mailbox using your own email provider — it does not pass through, or get stored by, our website infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h3>Information generated automatically</h3>
        <p>
          The website does not use cookies or any technology that stores information on, or reads information from, your device (see <a href="#cookies">Section 5</a>). We use Amazon CloudWatch RUM, a cookieless monitoring tool, to understand how the website is used and how well it performs. With cookies disabled it records the page visited, your browser, operating system and device type, the country and region your visit came from, page-load performance measurements, and any JavaScript errors. It does not create a user or session identifier, does not follow you between pages or visits, and does not track you across other websites. However, like any website, delivering a page to your browser inherently involves our hosting and content-delivery provider processing limited technical information — for example, your IP address, general browser and device information, and the page requested — for the short period needed to route and serve that request. Starixis does not itself collect, view, or compile this information into visitor profiles, and has not configured a dedicated access-logging or analytics pipeline for the website. We have not enabled content-delivery or storage access logging on our infrastructure, so no website access logs are collected on our behalf. Our infrastructure provider may retain minimal operational logs as a standard part of running its own service, for example for network security and reliability purposes; those logs are held under its own retention practices and are not accessible to us as website access records.
        </p>
        <p>We do not collect cookie identifiers or cookie-consent records, because no cookies are in use. The monitoring tool described in <a href="#cookies">Section 5</a> reports the country and region a visit came from, derived from your IP address; it does not provide us with your IP address itself, or with any more precise location.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-and-why">
        <h2>4. How and why we use information</h2>
        <p>We only use personal information for the purposes below, on the lawful bases shown. We do not rely on consent as the basis for handling your enquiries — consent is used only where the law specifically requires it, such as for non-essential cookies (which, as explained in <a href="#cookies">Section 5</a>, we do not currently use).</p>

          Where we rely on legitimate interests, we have considered that the processing is proportionate, expected in the context of a business enquiry or ordinary website operation, and does not override your own interests or fundamental rights.

      <section id="cookies">
        <h2>5. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The starixis.com website does not use cookies, local storage, session storage, IndexedDB, tracking pixels, browser fingerprinting, or any other technology that stores information on, or reads information from, your device.</strong> This was confirmed by a review of the website&rsquo;s source code as part of preparing this notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website does use Amazon CloudWatch RUM, a monitoring tool provided by our existing infrastructure provider, AWS. It is deliberately configured with cookies switched off. Because nothing is stored on or read from your device, the consent requirement under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations does not apply, and no cookie-consent banner is shown. We describe it here so that you know what is running. <a href="#information-we-collect">Section 3</a> sets out exactly what it records.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have not published a separate Cookie Notice, because no cookies are in use. If that changes in the future — for example if a cookie-based analytics tool, advertising technology or chat tool is introduced — this section will be updated, any non-essential technology will not run before you have given valid consent, and a dedicated Cookie Notice and consent mechanism will be put in place before that happens.

      <section id="sharing">
        <h2>6. When we share information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell website visitors&rsquo; personal information, and we do not share it with third parties for their own marketing purposes. We do share limited information with the categories of recipient below, where necessary for the purposes described in Section 4:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hosting and content-delivery provider</strong> — Amazon Web Services (AWS), which stores the website&rsquo;s files and delivers the website to your browser (see <a href="#international-transfers">Section 7</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Email/mailbox provider</strong> — Microsoft, which hosts the contact@starixis.com mailbox and therefore receives and stores messages you send us.</li>
          <li><strong>Website monitoring</strong> — Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides the cookieless CloudWatch RUM tool described in <a href="#cookies">Section 5</a>. The app monitor is hosted in the AWS London (eu-west-2) region.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional advisers</strong> — such as legal, accountancy, or other advisers, where necessary for the purposes described above.</li>
          <li><strong>Public authorities or regulators</strong> — where we are legally required to disclose information, for example in response to a valid legal request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from the cookieless monitoring tool described above, we do not use any third-party analytics provider, advertising or retargeting provider, CRM, contact-form backend, or chat tool that would receive website visitors&rsquo; personal information.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="international-transfers">
        <h2>7. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Our hosting and content-delivery provider, AWS, stores the website&rsquo;s files in the AWS London (eu-west-2) region. AWS also uses a global content-delivery network to serve the website faster to visitors; under our current configuration this network uses edge locations in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and North America. As a result, the limited technical/connection information described in <a href="#information-we-collect">Section 3</a> may be processed at edge locations outside the UK, including in the United States, as an ordinary part of how that network routes and delivers requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where personal information is transferred outside the UK in this way, we rely on the safeguards our providers make available for international transfers. These are provided under each provider&rsquo;s standard data processing terms — the AWS Data Processing Addendum, and the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum for the mailbox described in <a href="#sharing">Section 6</a> — which incorporate the EU Standard Contractual Clauses together with the UK Addendum. We do not claim that all providers store information only in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website itself is a set of static files and contains no personal information. The only personal information that may be processed outside the UK in connection with the website is the limited connection information described above, handled transiently as requests are routed and served.

        <p>
          We take reasonable organisational and technical steps to protect personal information handled in connection with the website. The website is served over HTTPS, is hosted in a private storage bucket that is not directly accessible from the internet, sits behind a content-delivery network configured with standard security response headers, and is deployed through a controlled build pipeline that requires manual approval before changes reach production.
